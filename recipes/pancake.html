    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        These pancakes are an absolute classic: they always turn out great, are wonderfully fluffy, 
        and taste delicious whether served sweet or savory. The secret lies in letting the batter 
        rest so the ingredients can bond perfectly. A simple base recipe that belongs in 
        every kitchen.
