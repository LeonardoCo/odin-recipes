This project will be my first one which I am doing on my own.
It will be a recipe website. The homepage will give an overview of the recipes and show links to each one, with example pictures beside them.

By completing this project, I will demonstrate my ability to:
- structure content using HTML
- Link multiple web pages together
- Display images and lists correctly
- organize a project from scratch
